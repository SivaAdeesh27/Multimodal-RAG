1. Use the secrets from colab_secrets.txt for the api access
2. upload the vits.pdf(vision transformer pdf file) and image_descriptions_gemini.csv which stores the image descriptions of vits.pdf
3.I have created a gradio interface which is commented as gradio server is currently down. So, I have defined a function to run the RAG pipeline without any interface.
4. Refer the video I have shared in the drive if any issues.
5. If you are running the code another time, make sure to change the persistent directory of vectordb, lets say the first time you run is stored in /content/docs1, if you restart and run second time, make sure let it be /content/docs2 or something.Or, you can clean the persistent dir. and can the file again.
