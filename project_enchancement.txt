Incorporate Evaluation Metrics for RAG:

Implement evaluation metrics for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Score) to measure performance and effectiveness.

Support for Multiple Documents:

Develop functionality to handle and process multiple documents, enhancing the capability to retrieve and generate information from various sources simultaneously.

Reduce Latency with Improved VLM:

Optimize latency by utilizing a more efficient Vision Language Model (VLM) than Gemini, ensuring faster response times and improved performance in processing visual and textual data.
